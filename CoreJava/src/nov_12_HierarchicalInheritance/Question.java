/*Assignment :
 ------------
 class name: EmployeeManagementSystem
 Create a Program to Develop Hierarchical Inheritance for Employee Management System
  
 Here Employee is super class and it has two sub classes PermanentEmployee and ContractEmployee.
    
 We need to display the details of PermanentEmployee including provident fund and net Salary.
 
 We need to display the details of ContractEmployee including contract
 duration.
  
 Coding Requirements :
 ----------------------
 Create a BLC class called Employee.
   
 Attributes/ Properties [protected]
 employeeId - int
 employeeName - String
 employeeSalary - double
  
 
 Create a Parameterized constructor to initialize all fields.
 Create another BLC class PermanentEmployee which extends from Employee
 
 Attributes/ Properties [protected]
 providentfund - double
  
  
 Create a parameterized constructor to initialize super class properties only
  
 [Note : providentfund property will not initialize through constructor]
  
   
 Initialize providentfund manually, It must be 12% of the salary.
 
 Genarate toString() method to print all the properties of super class as well as sub class.
 [See the test cases for more details]
  
 Method :
 --------
 Method Name  :   netSalary()
 Modifier     :   public
 Argument     :   No argument
 return type  :   void
  
 This method should print netSalary i.e salary + providentfund
  
 Create another BLC class ContractEmployee which extends from Employee
  
 Attributes/ Properties [protected]
  
 contractDuration - int
  
 Create a parameterized constructor to initialized all fields (super class and sub class)
  
 Genarate toString() method to print all the properties of super class as well as sub class.
 [See the test cases for more details]
  
  
 Create an ELC class EmployeeSystem which contains main method.
  
 Create both sub class objects and print the result.
  
  
 Test Cases for Output :
 ------------------------
    Test Case 1 :
    -------------
    Enter permanent employee Id :101
	Enter permanent employee Name :Scott
	Enter permanent employee Salary :100000
	PermanentEmployee [empoyeeId=101, employeeName=Scott, employeeSalary=100000.0, providentfund=12000.0]
	Net Salary is :112000.0
	========================================
	Enter contract employee Id :102
	Enter contract employee Name :Smith
	Enter contract employee Salary :80000
	Enter contract duration in year :5
	ContractEmployee [empoyeeId=102, employeeName=Smith, employeeSalary=80000.0, contractDuration=5 years]

    
  
    Test Cases for Input Validation :
    ---------------------------------
    Test Cases 1:
    -------------
	Enter permanent employee Id :-90
	Enter permanent employee Name :Scott
	Enter permanent employee Salary :12000
	Invalid Employee Id
	
	Test Cases 2:
    -------------
    Enter permanent employee Id :101
	Enter permanent employee Name :
	Enter permanent employee Salary :6543
	Employee Name can't be null

    Test Cases 3 :
    ---------------
    Enter permanent employee Id :120
	Enter permanent employee Name :Alen
	Enter permanent employee Salary :-78908
	Salary can't be 0 or negative*/
